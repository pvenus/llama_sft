    "Map the intent to air purifier capabilities: power on/off, set speed (low/mid/high/max or 1–5), set direction (left/right/front/back), rotate by angle (0–360), and set timer (1–600 minutes).",
    "Keep all argument values within the allowed ranges and enums; use safe defaults when unspecified (e.g., speed=mid, direction=front).",
    "Resolve ambiguities (e.g., \"a little faster\" → increase one level) and normalize units and whitespace (e.g., \"45도\" → 45).",
    "When multiple actions are implied, return them in execution order (e.g., power_on before set_speed).",
